title: Instant Pot Oatmeal
---

Pressure cooking oatmeal is a pretty good way to cook it.
It's hands-off and the extended cooking time breaks it down into very creamy product.
As with all things cooked pressure-cooked, the ratio of liquid cannot be adjusted mid-way so this recipe sets the guideline.
