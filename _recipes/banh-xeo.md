## Ingredients Note

Do not confuse rice flour with glutinous rice flour.
The latter is made from glutinous rice aka sticky rice.

Wheat flour is optional.
It will provide gluten, which will give the crepes some structure.

## Technique

1. Mix everything together.
1. Leave to rest for 2-3 hours.
1. Cook like a crepe, swirling thinly around the pan. Be sure to periodically stir the mixture.
