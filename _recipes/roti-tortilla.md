Recently I discovered that roti was the same flatbread as flour tortillas:

* Both are composed of the same ingredients: flour, salt, and water
* Both are unleavened
* Both are cooked on a griddle or directly over open flame

I used this chapati recipe from [King Arthur Flour][1].
From my understanding, roti is a general term for indian flatbreads and analogous with chapati.
Depending on whether whole wheat is used or whether oil is present, they can be named differently.
But all are consumed in the same dishes.

To make [flour tortillas][2], add some baking powder.
This will give a little puff and texture.
Oil might also be needed, to make it more pliable.

Since [corn tortillas][3] are very similar in technique, I'll go ahead and add them as well.
It's masa harina and water, with optional fat (lard or oil).

## Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's % | Amount for 2 roti (g)
|-|-:|-:|
Flour | 100 | 40
Water | 75 | 30
Salt | 1.2 | sprinkle

If oil or other fat is to be used, then the hydration must be decreased to compensate for stickiness.
The dough will be more supple and malleable, making it harder to initially knead.

## Technique

### Flour Tortilla/Roti

1. Mix flour and salt.
1. If oil is used, then cut into flour and mix well with hands.
    There should not be clumps larger than the size of peas.
1. Make a well in the flour and pour in water.
    This can be done in a bowl or directly on the counter.
1. Knead until smooth.
1. Portion dough and shape into balls.
1. Cover and rest for 15 minutes.
1. Lightly grease and preheat cast iron or griddle.
    The temperature should be similar to that used for pancakes (water sizzles but doesn't dance).
1. Roll the balls into 6" tortillas. They should be very thin, 3 mm.
1. Fry in the pan.
    Use a spatula to press down any bubbles and ensure contact.
1. Flip when golden brown and cook other side.
    This should only take about 30 seconds.

### Corn Tortilla

1. Mix masa harina and water.
1. Knead well.
    Unlike flour doughs, there's no gluten.
    So you can squeeze and treat it like play dough.
1. Rest for 20 minutes, to allow dough to hydrate.
1. Preheat cast iron pan.
    No need to grease.
1. Split into 3 balls.
1. Surround with wax paper.
1. Roll flat with rolling pin or press flat with pot.
1. Fry in the pan.
1. Flip when one side drys out and browns.

If the dough sticks, then it's too wet.
Let it dry or add some masa harina.

If it crumbles or tears during rolling, then it's too dry.
Wet hands and knead back into the dough balls.
