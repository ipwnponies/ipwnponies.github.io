## Recipe

- 2 lb or pork shoulder
- 250 g onion, diced
- 200 g carrots, chunked
- 2 celery stalks, sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, smashed
- Spices (oregano, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup red wine
- 1 can (28 ounce) tomatoes

### Ingredient Notes

Pork can contain bones or cartilage.
The bones can be removed before shredding and cartilage will gelatinize to form body of sauce.

## Technique

1. Brown meat and set aside.
1. Saute onions, spices, and tomato paste.
1. Deglaze with wine or stock. Reduce to a syrup, 50%.
1. Add pork back and pressure cook for 40 minutes.
1. Remove pork.
  Debone if necessary.
  Roughly shred pork.
1. Add pork back and bring to boil.
1. Boil rapidly for a minute to emulsify the sauce.

### Cooking Notes

Reduce wine to a syrup, if using a pressure cooker.
Otherwise there will be too excess liquid.

Browning meat, deglazing, and reducing is recommended to be done in a wide pan.
This is much faster than attempting to do so directly in the instant pot, which would take about 3 times longer.
