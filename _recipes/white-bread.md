# Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage
-|-
Flour | 100% (by definition, for completeness)
Water | 63%
Honey | 6.5%
Yeast | 1.5%
Salt | 1.8%
Butter (softened) | 6%
Milk powder | 7%

## Note

Yeast is 7 g == 2.25 tsp.

The yeast was very vigorous in my warm kitchen (25 C). Consider using less yeast and allowing a longer rise (maybe 70%).

# Technique

1. Mix everything in a stand mixer.
    The dough should be smooth (not sticky) and very soft when done, >10 minutes.
1. Rise dough for 60-90 minutes.
1. Punch down dough and roughly shape into a log.
1. Put dough into a greased and floured pan.
    Allow to rise for 45 minutes.
1. Preheat oven to 350F (175C).
1. Bake for 40 minutes.
    When crust starts getting brown, cover with tin foil.
    Bread is done when at 195-200F.
1. Cool on rack completely before bagging away.
