The original recipe has a serving size of 2, this is 50% larger portion and only single serving.

## Ingredients

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage | Amount per serving
-|-:|-:
Flour | 100% | 15 g
Sugar (or splenda) | 200% | 30 g (3 g)
Cocoa powder | 66% | 10 g
Salt | 2% | pinch
Baking Powder | 5% | 1/8 tsp (0.5 g)
Milk | 200% | 30 g
Mayo | 200% | 30 g
Vanilla extract | - | 1/8 tsp

### Ingredient Notes

The sugar can be entirely replaced with splenda, since sugar doesn't play a structural role.
And there isn't any Maillard reaction with microwave cooking.

This will produce a rich, decadent chocolate cake.
Reducing the mayo will produce a lighter chocolate cake.

## Technique

1. Mix all dry ingredients into a bowl.
1. Add wet ingredients and mix until smooth.
1. Microwave for 60-75 seconds.
  The cake is done when the tops are dry to the touch (dependent on the mug shape).
