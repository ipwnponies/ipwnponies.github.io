The xoi recipe is based off of [Da Nang Cuisine][1].

# Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage
-|-
Glutinous Rice | 100%
Coconut Milk | 50%
Water | 25%
Shredded Coconut | 15%
Salt | 1.5%

For the topping, it's a 50/50 mix of sugar and nuts.
And a pinch of salt, to give it a sweet-savoury profile.

# Technique

1. Soak the rice overnight.
    This step might not be required if pressure-cooking (needs testing).
1. Combine ingredients.
1. Steam or use rice cooker.
    This will take longer than jasmine rice, probably 2-3 times the cook time.

Using the Instant Pot, I cooked on on high for 20 whole minutes and allowed Natural Release.
