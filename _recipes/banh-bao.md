# Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's %
|-|-|
Flour | 100% (by definition, just adding for completeness)
Water | 55%
Sugar | 15%
Oil | 5%
Yeast | 2%
Salt | 1.5 %

# Technique

1. Activate yeast, with sugar and liquid (water or milk).
1. Mix everything together and knead until smooth.
1. Proof, ~60-90 minutes.
1. Split the dough into balls.
    * If plain, roll as a ball and get a tight skin.
    * If filled, roll real thin, and fill.
1. Proof for second rise, ~45 minutes.
1. Steam at rolling boil until finished, ~7 min.
1. Cool on rack.

# Tips

* With 100 g flour, 4 balls will be 43 gram
  * These will make the smallest reasonable size
  * Steam for 7 minute
  * Larger bao found in stores are probably 2.5-3x.
* This will be a stiffer dough
