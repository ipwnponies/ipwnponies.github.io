# Recipe

* 30 g of casein protein powder
* 5 g of xanthan gum
* 250 ml of cold liquid (can use pop)

# Technique

1. Whisk xanthan powder into protein.
    This step is important to ensure the xanthan gum doesn't clump as soon as it's mixed with liquid.
1. Add liquid.
1. Whisk on medium-low speed.
    It'll look like a goopy batter.
1. After a few minutes, mixture should look evenly mixed.
    Crank the speed up to med-high.
1. After about 10-15 minute, the fluff should be stiff enough to stick to the bowl.
    Think like meringue test.
    If it doesn't fluff, chill the batter with crushed ice.

# Tips

* ~~I don't think carbonated beverage is strictly required.~~
    I've experimented with using only water and it works the same.
* The xanthan gum needs to be dispersed in other powders, to evenly distribute and prevent clumping.
    The protein powder doesn't seem fine enough, consider mixing it into powdered sugar or splenda, to bulk it out.
* You can add more xanthan gum but try to avoid it if you can.
    Xanthan gum clumps easily and has an unappealing texture.
* There's no need to use frozen fruit.
    That said, the slush may aerate more readily, as well as keeping the mixture cool.
* It will fluff more readily if cold.
* Believe in yourself, it will eventually fluff.
    It looks like a hot mess in the beginning but will eventually gain stability.
