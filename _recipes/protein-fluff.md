# Recipe

* 30 g of casein protein powder
* 5 g of xanthan gum
* 330 ml of pop

# Technique

1. Whisk xanthan powder into protein.
    This step is important to ensure the xanthan gum doesn't clump as soon as it's mixed with liquid.
2. Whisk on medium-low speed.
    It'll look like a goopy mess.
3. After a few minutes, mixture should look evenly mixed.
    Crank the speed up to med-high.
4. After about 10-15 minute, the fluff should be stiff enough to stick to the bowl.
    Think like meringue test.

# Tips

* I don't think carbonated beverage is strictly required.
    I want to experiment using water and sugar, or juice.
* The xanthan gum needs to be dispersed in other powders, to evenly distribute and prevent clumping.
    The protein powder doesn't seem fine enough, consider mixing it into powdered sugar or splenda, to bulk it out.
* There's no need to use frozen fruit.
    That said, the slush may aerate more readily, as well as keeping the mixture cool.
* Believe in yourself, it will eventually fluff.
    It looks like a hot mess in the beginning but will eventually gain stability.
    If not, try the recipe again with more xanthan gum.
    Don't overdo it though, xanthan gum texture and taste is less than desirable.
