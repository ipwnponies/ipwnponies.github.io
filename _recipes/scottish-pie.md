I found two recipes that caught my eye and tried to incorporate the elements from both:
[BigOven][1] and [King Arthur Flour][2].

## Hot water crust

### Recipe

Ingredient | Weight (g) | Baker's Percentage (%)
-|-|-
Flour | 360 | 100
Lard | 85 | 24
Water | 170 | 47
Salt | 3 | 1

### Technique

1. Bring fat and water to a boil.
1. Mix dry ingredients with mixture in mixing bowl.
1. Mix until everything is evenly hydrated.
1. Once cooled enough to handle, knead a **few times** by hand.
  Do not overmix, knead enough so that dough doesn't tear easily.
1. Remove 1/3 and roll into 4 4" lids.
  Set aside.
1. With remaining 2/3, roll out 4 more 6" circles.
1. Shape crusts with a bowl or jar that is 4" in diameter.
1. Chill crusts in refrigerator for 1 hour before using.

- Hot water crust is forgiving when shaping.
  Tears can be patched with scraps.
- Dough should be rolled to ~1/4".

## Pie

### Pie Recipe

- 500 g ground meat
- 140 g chopped onions
- 30 g oatmeal
- salt, nutmeg, thyme
- fish sauce

---

- 100 ml gravy

---

- 4 pie crusts

### Pie Technique

1. Mix together all ingredients, except for gravy.
1. Fill into crust.
1. Close crust with lids and crimp shut.
  Be sure to seal well.
1. Poke out hole, size of wood spoon handle.
1. Pour gravy into the hole.
1. Egg wash.
1. Bake at 325 for 30 minutes.

- Unlike a shortcrust, there's no flakiness to strive for.
  This means we can use a lower temperature.
- Definitely egg wash, it will look drab otherwise.
