This is based on the queso dip on [foodwishes].
I opted to skip the tomatoes and also used fresh jalape√±os instead of canned chilies.

# Recipe

* 225 g cheese
* 1 tsp cornstarch
* 2 cloves garlic
* 10 g oil
* 1 bunch green onion
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* 180 ml evaporated milk (1/2 can)

# Technique

1. Grate cheese and dust lightly with corn starch.
1. Lightly saute green onion (white parts), garlic.
1. Add spices and allow to bloom.
1. Add evaporated milk and bring to a boil.
1. Whisk in cheese, 1/4 at a time.
1. Remove from heat as soon as the cheese is added and sauce is brought up to serving temperature.

# Tips

* The cheese only needs to be incorporated, it should not be boiled.
  This can break emulsion.
* If not using cornstarch, can start with a roux.
* Chili spices will cause the finished queso to be yellow, skip if your goal is to get a white colour.
* No salt is mentioned in the recipe because I found the salt from cheese and tortilla chips are more than enough.
  Additional salt causes the dip to be on a salty end.
  But as always, season to taste.
* This will likely be too thick, especially as it cools.
  Thin it it out with water or stock, probably 30-50 ml.
