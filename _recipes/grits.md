title: Grits
---

Grits are very thirsty grains.
This recipe will give a thick texture, one that will solidify into a gel block once refrigerated.

## Recipe

Ingredient | Ratio | Serving size (g)
-|-:|-:
Grits (quick) | 100% | 37
Water | 550% | 200
Salt | 2% | 0.5

Water can and should be substituted for a flavourful liquid, such as stock.

This recipe was tested on quick grits.
I'm told that this is sacrilegious.
Oops.
I think the ratio might still be the same for stone-ground grits but the cook time will need to be for longer.

## Technique

1. Mix everything together.
1. Cook in instant pot for 20 minutes.
1. Serve with cheese/meats and fresh herb garnish.
