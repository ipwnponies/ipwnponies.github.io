I adapted the recipe from [Serious Eats][1].

## Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage | Serving size for 9-inch cake (g)
-|-:|-
Butter (room temp) | 100% | 120
Sugar | 63% | 75
Flour | 17% | 20
Milk | 100% | 125
Vanilla extract | 4% | 5
Salt | 1% | 1

### Recipe Notes

This will make enough frosting for evenly layering a 9-inch round cake.
The layer will be thin, about 1 cm thick.
Double the recipe if you want to do a layer cake and piping .

## Technique

1. Place a sauce pan, with milk and flour, over medium heat.
1. Whisk constantly as the roux cooks.
  This will only take a few minutes.
1. Remove from heat when consistency reaches thick pudding stage.
1. Whisk in sugar and salt.
1. Scrape into a flat plate and leave to cool to room temperature (21 C).
1. Beat butter until light and fluffy.
1. Add pudding, a few tablespoons at a time.
  Allow to fully incorporate before adding more.
1. When all incorporated, switch to whisk head.
1. Add vanilla and/or flavourings.
1. Whisk until light, about 24 C.

### Technique Notes

If the frosting feels dense, greasy, and curdled, this means it's too cold.
The butter is not able to emulsify properly.
Either leave the frosting alone to warm a little or place over a double-boiler.
Then re-whip once temperature is closer to 24 C.

If the frosting is too loose, then it's too warm and the butter has melted.
Refrigerate for 10 minutes in the fridge.
Re-whip once temperature is closer to 24 C.
