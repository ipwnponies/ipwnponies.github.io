title: Self-Rising Flour
---

Self-rising flour is flour that is mixed with salt and baking powder.
Because the ratio of leavening and salt is pretty consistent across many quick bread bakes, this product exists as a
convenience and is multi-purpose.
We're talking muffins, biscuits, pancakes, banana bread, etc.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient    | Baker's Percentage |   1 cup | Weight (g) |
| ------------- | -----------------: | ------: | ---------- |
| Flour         |               100% |   1 cup | 120        |
| Baking powder |                 6% | 1.5 tsp | 8          |
| Salt          |               1.5% | 1/4 tsp | 2          |

### Notes

Use all-purpose or lower protein flour, such as White Lilly.
Self-rising flour is used in recipes that use chemical leavening, which usually avoid gluten development.

## Technique

1. Mix everything together.
2. Store as you would flour.
   Ingredients are shelf-stable but the baking powder can lose potency as it sits.
