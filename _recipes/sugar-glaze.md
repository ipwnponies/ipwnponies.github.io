title: Sugar Glaze
---

## Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage
-|-:
Powdered Sugar | 100%
Water (or milk) | 30%
Butter (melted) | 15%
Vanilla | 2%

### Notes

Substitute water for milk to add additional flavour.
The fat from milk will soften the glaze and make it pliable.

Add butter optionally for flavour and fat.
Again, fat makes the glaze soft and pliable when set.

Vanilla is optional and strictly for flavour.

## Technique

1. Whisk all ingredients together.
1. Adjust consistency.
  Aim for consistency that ribbons, like crepe batter.
  We want the glaze to spread itself thin.
1. Glaze pastries and allow to dry.
1. Continually stir and readjust consistency as the glaze dries out.
