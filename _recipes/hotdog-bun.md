# Tips

* This will produce a light brioche bun dough, which is sticky, soft, and supple.
* 50 g will create very large and sturdy buns.
  Probably 30 g will result in the smaller, store-bought buns.
* This dough is quite soft and sticky, consider using more flour to get a stiffer dough.
* The eggs and sugar in this dough will result in a yellow-ish colour, and this bun will brown easily.
