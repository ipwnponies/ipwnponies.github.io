## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Baker's % | Single Portion (g) |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Flour      | -         | 60                 |
| Water      | 50%       | 30                 |
| Salt       | 1.5%      | 1/8 tsp            |

### Ingredient Note

I used all-purpose and it works well.
It develops enough gluten to give a good chew.
As these are hand-pulled and wide noodles, using bread flour might not be desirable.

## Technique

1. Mix all ingredients together by hand.
   Knead only until well incorporated.
1. Allow to rest for 30 minutes.
   This is the autolyse.
1. Knead the dough until smooth, about 5 minutes.
1. Form dough into a ball, split in two, and roll into logs.
1. Oil well and let rest for 2 hours.
1. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a long rectangle.
   Use a chopstick to score the center line.
1. Using hands, pull apart gently.
   Bang on the table to encourage stretching.
1. Hand rip down the middle seam.
1. Cook in boiling water, 60 seconds.
1. Serve tossed with bok choy and chili oil.

## Chili Oil

To make chili oil, mix:

- 1 tsp sichuan peppercorn
- 4 tsp chili flakes
- minced garlic
- green onion
- 1 tbsp oil

Microwave for 60 seconds.
