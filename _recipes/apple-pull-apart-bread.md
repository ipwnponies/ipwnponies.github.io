title: Apple Pull-Apart Bread
---

Pull-apart bread is a filled, enriched bread.
It's in the same family of bakes as cinnamon rolls and monkey-bread.
It's "pull-apart" much like monkey bread but with more structure.
Rather than rolled like cinnamon rolls, the layers are cut and neatly stacked horizontally, then placed into a loaf pan.
Honestly, you could just roll these up like cinnamon rolls.

This recipe is adapted from [King Arthur Baking][1].
