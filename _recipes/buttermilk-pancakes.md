## Technique

1. Sift all dry ingredients together.
1. Whisk all wet ingredients together in another bowl.
1. Mix wet into dry.
   Mix until there are no more dry clumps but is still lumpy.
1. Preheat pan until water droplets dance on the surface. Lower the heat slightly from this point.
1. Use a 1/4 cup as a scoop, ladle out pancakes.
   Cover with a lid, to steam the top.
1. Flip after halfway cooked, about 1-1.5 minutes.
1. Serve.

## Tips

* This will produce a thick, lumpy batter, which results in tall pancakes.
  Thin it out with water or milk.
* Cool pancakes on a cooling rack, to avoid soggy bottoms.
* If these brown too quickly, reduce sugar or baking soda.
