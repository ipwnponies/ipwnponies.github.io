# Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's Percentage | Amount for 4 servings (g)
-|-|-
Flour | 100% | 240
Tapioca Starch | 30% | 72
Salt | 4% | 10
Water | 48% | 150

## Note

The amount of salt is higher than typical.
Most doughs are around 1.8%, this is double that.
When it comes time to cook, boil in unseasoned water.

# Technique

## Dough

1. Dissolve salt into water.
1. Mix all ingredients in a bowl or on counter.
    Mix and knead until it all the flour comes together.
    Dough should be shaggy and seem too dry.
1. Place the dough into a ziploc bag.
    Close bag halfway, leaving it open for air to escape.
1. Knead by stepping on the dough with ball and heels of the feet.
    Continue until the dough is fully flattened.
1. Remove dough and fold it in half several times.
1. Repeat kneading.
1. Rest dough for 30 minutes.
    Squeeze all air out of the bag, to prevent the dough from drying out.
1. Repeat kneading.
1. Rest the dough for >3 hours or overnight in the fridge.

## Cutting

1. Roll the dough out, using the rolling pin or the pasta roller.
    The thickness is about 1/8" (3 mm).
1. Cut the noodles.
    Noodles should be wider than ramen, maybe fettuccine.
1. Noodles can now be frozen or cooked right away.
    Can store in the fridge for a day or two but they cook from frozen just as quickly as from fridge.

During the rolling and cutting process, be sure to liberally dust with tapioca starch to prevent sticking.

# Cooking

1. Bring water to a boil.
    Do not season, the dough is heavily seasoned already.
1. Cook until done.
1. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop further cooking.
