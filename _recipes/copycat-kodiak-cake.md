## Recipe

Ingredient | Mass (g) | Ratio | Single Serving (g)
-|-:|-: |-:
Flour | 160 | 100% | 20
Oats | 80 | 50% | 10
Whey protein | 80 | 50% | 10
Brown sugar |  15 g | 7.5% | 2
Baking powder | 15 g | 7.5% | 2
Salt | 2 | 1% | 1/4

I would recommend cooking 2 servings at a time, as each serving requires 1/2 egg.
The whole mix above is 8 servings.

Ingredient | Ratio | Single serving (g) | Double serving, practicality (g)
-|-:|-:|-:
Pancake Mix | 100% | 45 | 90
Egg | 55% | 1/2 egg (25 g) | 1 egg
Milk | 100% | 45 | 90

### Chia Seed

Chia seeds can be used as an egg replacement.
1 tbsp (10 g) of chia seeds is the substitute for 1 whole egg.

Ingredient | Ratio | Single serving (g)
-|-:|-:
Pancake Mix | 100% | 45
Chia seed | 7% | 3
Water | 175% | 100

## Technique

1. Measure dry mix into a bowl.
1. If desired, add some oil.
  This is less optional if using egg whites instead of whole eggs or water instead of milk.
1. Stir with chopstick or fork, until mostly mixed.
  It's harder to overmix, as there's less gluten in this mix.
  But don't be a pancake cooking baddie.
1. Each serving makes 3 smaller pancake or 2 normal sized pancakes.
