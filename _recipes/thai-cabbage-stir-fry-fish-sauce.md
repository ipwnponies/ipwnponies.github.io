This dish is a simple, rustic Thai dish.
I like it because it only requires simple ingredients that are both staples and non-perishable.
This allows me to cook dishes spontaneously.

The Vietnamese phonetic pronunciation would be approximately "ga lầm pli pặd năm pla".
This is transliterated into "Cabbage, fried with fish sauce".

This recipe is from [*Hot Thai Kitchen*][1].

# Recipe

* 200 g cabbage, cut into 2 inch pieces
* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* 8-10 cloves of garlic, smashed
* 1/4 tsp white pepper

## Notes

* Cabbage can also be cut roughly into strips.
    We don't want the cabbage to be too small, as it'll overcook and lose the texture.
    But we also don't want the pieces too big, otherwise the fish sauce flavour will not evenly spread.
* You'll want to use good tasting fish sauce.
    The entire flavour of this dish comes from the fish sauce, it's not used as a flavour base.
* Garlic should not be minced too finely, otherwise it can burn.
* You can substitute black pepper.
    There will be a difference in flavour but not enough to impact the final dish.

# Technique

1. Heat a wok over medium heat.
1. Add oil to coat the bottom.
1. Add garlic right away, while the oil is warming up.
1. Once garlic is starting to turn golden, add cabbage.
    Toss cabbage to evenly cover with oil.
    Turn up the heat.
1. Add fish sauce.
    It should bubble and caramelize.
1. Remove from heat after cabbage is evenly coated in sauce.
1. Add pepper as garnish and toss.
1. Serve.
