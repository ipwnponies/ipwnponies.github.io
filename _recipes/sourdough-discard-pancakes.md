This recipe was adapted from [What's Cooking America][1].
I've converted the units to weights and scaled it to a single serving.

## Recipe

Ingredient |  Baker's Percentage (%)| One egg recipe (g) | Single serving (g)
-|-:|-:| -:
flour, from starter | 100 | 250  | 50
water, from starter | 100 | 250 | 50
sugar | 12 |30 | 6
egg | 20 | 1 egg | 10 g (can use a touch of egg white or omit)
oil | 20 | 50 | 10
salt | 1 | 2.5 | 0.5
baking soda | 2 | 5 | 1.0 (less than 1/4 tsp)

This assumes a 100% hydration starter.
Calculations are based off the flour portion of the starter.
There are no additional liquids in the recipe, the 100% hydration starter provides both flour and water.

If needed, can add some flour to increase the viscosity, which will result in thicker, fluffier, and taller pancakes.
