# Recipe

I use the dough from [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/soft-cinnamon-rolls-recipe).
It's uses a tangzhong method, which is a roux that's made with 10% of the flour.
This helps to keep the final bake moist, by increasing the flour's ability to hold on to moisture.

## Tangzhong

* 70 g water
* 70 g milk
* 28 g flour

### Technique

The tangzhong is a simple roux.
Whisk flour and liquids until well-mixed.
Gently heat up and continue whisking.
Tangzhong is done when the roux "leaves lines" after spatula or whisk if pulled through.

That being said, I've overcooked the tangzhong to the point where it's completely thickened.
The resulting bake still comes out just fine.

## Dough

* tangzhong
* 500 g flour
* 20 g milk powder
* 8 g salt
* 1 tbsp yeast (whole packet)
* 170 g milk, lukewarm
* 2 large eggs
* 85 g butter (3/4 of stick)

## Filling

The frosting filling comes from [SeriousEats].

* 170 g brown sugar
* 15 g cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1 g salt

# Putting it Together

The technique is pretty straightforward:

1. Mix ingredients together.
1. Leave to autolyse for 20 minutes.
1. Knead well.
1. Shape into a ball, let rest for 60 to 90 minutes.
Timing will depend on how warm the initial dough is, how warm the kitchen is, how much yeast was used, etc.
1. Roll out into a 18"x8" rectangle. Be sure to dust a little flour.
1. Spread filling evenly.
1. Roll up along the long edge.
1. Square off the ends and cut into 12 equal pieces.
1. Freeze or continue to baking.

# Baking

1. Set rolls close to each other, allowing room to expand.
1. Proof for additional 45 minutes. The rolls should touch each other lightly.
1. Bake at 350 F for 15 minutes. Target internal temperature of 188 F.
