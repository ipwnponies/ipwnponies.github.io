The recipe I used comes from [Kraft Canada][1].

# Recipe

Cheesecake is real simple:

- 113 g cream cheese (1 package)
- 50 g sugar
- 1 egg
- 8 Oreos
- Pinch of salt, probably 1-1.5 g.

I used light cream cheese, also known as neufchatel.
The ratios and techniques will be the same, although the outcome can have slight variation in texture and taste.

I used "apple cinnamon" flavoured oreos, which are the larger ones.
You should consider using 12 regular oreos if you want to maintain the ratio balance.
This results in a less of your traditional cheesecake (real tall, thing graham crust), which is my preference.
There's enough balance between the cookie and cheesecake to keep the palate refreshed between bites.

# Technique

Make sure everything is at room temperature.
Put the cream cheese into a mixing bowl and roughly mash it to increase the surface area.
Leave the egg out on the counter.
This will probably take 30-40 minutes.

Mix the cream cheese and sugar together.
Whip until well blended, we trying to avoid creaming and aerating the batter.
Add in the egg and salt and mix until blended.

Line muffin tin with liners.
Place an oreo in each.
Pour batter overtop.

Into the oven at 150 C (300 F).
Depending on the size, this will take between 10-15 min.
They're ready when the top is set, with a slight wiggle.

Let cool and chill for 3 hours before serving.
These freeze well.
