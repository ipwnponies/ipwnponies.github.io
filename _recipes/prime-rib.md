I followed [Serious Eats][1] recipe for instructions.

## Recipe

With this cut of beef, there's nothing you really need to do beyond salting.

- Rib roast
- salt

## Technique

1. Generously salt the roast all over.
1. Leave in refrigerator overnight, uncovered.

This dry brine and leaving the meat uncovered is typical for drying out the surface.

1. Preheat oven to lowest temperature possible.
    My oven went down to 170F/75C.
1. Put roast in and wait for hours.
1. Remove once desired temp (135F/55C for medium-rare) is reached.
1. Preheat oven to the highest it can go.
    My oven went up to 500F/260C.
1. Put roast in and watch it crisp.
    This will require constant attention to ensure it doesn't burn or overcook.

### Notes

The lower oven temperatures might not be accurate (even though ovens are not super accurate to begin with).
This is fine, just don't blindly use someone else's settings and time estimates, you'll need to adjust.

Remove the meat once it reaches desired doneness, not before.
The low oven temperature results in very slow heat transfer and there will not be much "carry-over" energy that
continues to rise the internal temperature.
