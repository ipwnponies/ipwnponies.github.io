I used this recipe from [Simply Recipes][1] to get inspired.
But this sauce doesn't require a recipe, it's more of a general idea for an herb sauce.
Feel free to tweak as you like, as long as you continue to hit the primary flavour notes of herbaceous and garlicky.

## Recipe

- 1 cup of parsley, finely chopped
- 3 cloves of garlic, roughly smashed
- 1 tbsp dry oregano
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 tbsp wine vinegar
- 2 tsp chili flakes
- salt
- pepper

These numbers are from memory.
The exact values don't matter, the general ratio will be in the right ball park.
Adjust to taste, for all ingredients.

## Technique

The easy and recommended way is to shove everything into a food processor and move on with life.
But I decided to use a mortar and pestle and so we have this intricate process.

1. Grind garlic, salt, and pepper. Add some oil if needed.
1. Add chili flakes and oregano (dry spices).
1. Add parsley. Keep paste dry-ish, it will help with grinding.
1. Once everything is finely mashed, add remaining oil and wine vinegar.
1. Grind but with the intent to emulsify.
