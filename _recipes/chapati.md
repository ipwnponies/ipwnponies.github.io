Recently I discovered that roti was the same flatbread as flour tortillas:

* Both are composed of the same ingredients: flour, salt, and water
* Both are unleavened
* Both are cooked on a griddle or directly over open flame

I used this chapati recipe from [King Arthur Flour][1].
From my understanding, roti is a general term for indian flatbreads and analogous with chapati.
Depending on whether whole wheat is used or whether oil is present, they can be named differently.
But all are consumed in the same dishes.

## Recipe

Ingredient | Baker's % | Amount for 2 roti (g)
|-|-:|-:|
Flour | 100% | 40 g
Water | 75 % | 30
Salt | 1.2 % | 1/12 tsp, a sprinkle

## Technique

1. Mix flour and salt.
1. Make a well in the flour and pour in water.
    This can be done in a bowl or directly on the counter.
1. Knead until smooth.
1. Portion dough and shape into balls.
1. Cover and rest for 15 minutes.
1. Lightly grease and preheat cast iron or griddle.
    The temperature should be similar to that used for pancakes (water sizzles but doesn't dance).
1. Roll the balls into 6" tortillas. They should be very thin, 3 mm.
1. Fry in the pan.
    Use a spatula to press down any bubbles and ensure contact.
1. Flip when golden brown and cook other side.
    This should only take about 30 seconds.
