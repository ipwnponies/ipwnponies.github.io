I was able to experience New York pizza on my recent visit to NYC.
They know what they're doing with pizza there.

## Experience

The cultural experience of pizza in New York is great and unique.
It's fast food because the pizza is pre-made and quickly served.
They have a team in the back that's set up like an assembly line to churn out pizzas.
They have a guy for every role:

- spinning out dough constantly and topping the pizzas
- tending to the oven
- taking orders and reheating slices
- cashier

It's fast-paced but orderly.
To a beginner, it can be a bit much.
You're not given enough time to see the wares and menu before you're expected to put in an order.
If it's your first time, I'd suggest sticking with a cheese slice to play it safe.
If they can masterfully handle the dough, maintain the balance between cheese and sauce, and hit the correct oven
temperature, then you're golden.

## Lingo

You order by slices or pies.
e.g. "two slices of pepperoni" or "a pepperoni pie".

For cheese pizza, the the terminology is "plain slice", "regular slice", or simply "slice".

## Dollar Pizza

There are dollar pizza joints everywhere.
They haven't raised the prices in 20 years.
These apply only to cheese slices and are high-volume, low margin products.
I don't know how they manage to make it work, I think it's a loss leader at this point.

Every other pizza place follows the price of the subway, which is currently $2.75.

The great thing about dollar slice is their high turnover means you can easily get a fresh slice.
There's no need to reheat in the oven.
It's a great serving temperature, where the slice has cooled enough to immediately eat but not enough to be unpleasantly
cold (unless you like that).
