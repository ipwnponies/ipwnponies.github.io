It's very commonly used in desserts.
It has a mild, aromatic flavour, akin to vanilla or pandan.

In Vietnamese, it's known as khoai mo.

## Taro

Taro is a root vegetable, like a carrot or radish.
It is white and speckled, with a faint shade of purple.
It's so lightly coloured that it appears gray in colour.

Taro can be used in desserts too.
Again, it is also mild and aromatic.
Taro can also be seen cooked in large chunks, like potatoes.
This contrasts with ube, which would be grated or mashed.

In Vietnamese, it's known as khoai mon.
