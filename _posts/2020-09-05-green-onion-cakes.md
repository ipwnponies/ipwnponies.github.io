It's [been long time] since I got back on the horse but here we are.
I made green onion cakes again and have made improvements to my [recipe][1] with learnings from my experimentation.

This was inspired after watching [Inga Lam][2].
The recipe and technique she uses jive with some of the changes I wanted to try out:

- lowering hydration
- making a roux paste
- rolling out to a rectangle
- no second roll step

And these are the same things I gleaned from [Omnivore's Cookbook][4].

## Updates

### Roux

First change is to use a roux, instead of spreading oil directly on rolled-out pancake.
This allows for a thicker spread than oil alone, which will not readily leak out.
When cooked, this will allow for definitive flaky layers.

This is actually a lower baker's percentage than normal roux: a traditional roux is 1:1 oil to flour by volume.
This is about 180% of oil.

Instead, aim for 150%.
This will make the paste a little thicker and will allow for more to adhere to the pancake layer.

### Rolling into a rectangle

Rolling into a rectangle, and treating this like a cinnamon roll, is definitely the way to go.
It's produces an even rolled, with less spillage out the sides.

It's not a big deal but I think it was tidier to work wtih.

### Lower hydration

The [Serious Eats][5] has a hydration of 75%, which is too sticky.
It might work well if you are using a food processor, which can quickly build the gluten required to make this easier
to handle.

The dough felt much better at 60% hydration for hand-kneading.
The dough was ever so slightly sticky, needing a dusting of flour for every step.
I wouldn't attempt higher than 60% unless you can use bread flour, which has higher protein content.

### Resting before final roll

After rolling up and coiling, the cakes are left to rest.
This allows gluten to relax before final roll.

This is not usually a problem as you can simply move on to rolling the remaining dough balls.
And then continuing with prepping for frying.
