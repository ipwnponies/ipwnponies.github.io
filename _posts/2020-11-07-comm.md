`comm` is a unix tool that is useful for doing line diffs between two sorted files.
It let's you view lines that are unique to `file1`, lines unique to `file2`, or lines that are in common (set intersection).

It has an invariant check that will warn when the files are not in sorted order.
You're going to want to use this to compare sets, without whipping out a python or node repl.
With python:

1. Read each file
1. Produce two sets `file.readlines()`
1. Perform set operations

- `set1 - set2` to get lines unique to `set1`
- `set2 - set1` to get lines unique to `set2`
- `set1 & set2` to get lines that exist in both
- `set1 ^ set2` to get lines are not in common

## Usage

```sh
# Only lines in common
comm -12 1.txt 2.txt

# Lines only found in 1.txt
comm -23 1.txt 2.txt

# Lines only found in 2.txt
comm -13 1.txt 2.txt
```
