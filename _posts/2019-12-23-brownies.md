Brownies come in different varieties: chewy, cakey, and fudgy.
These varieties vary the ingredients to move the brownie along a spectrum of pastries, from cakes to fudge to cookies.

I've found a recipe for each type and analyzed the composition.

Shoutout to the _pancake princess_ for the [brownie bake-off][1] and giving me a starting point for finding recipes as
well as categorizing them.

## Cakey

Cakey brownies are the easiest to categorize: they're like cakes.
However, it's not like you take a cake recipe and pour into a pan.

On a chocolate cake spectrum of richness, it goes:

1. chocolate cake
1. _devil's food_ cake
1. brownies

Brownies have more fat and sugar than rich chocolate cakes.
This would cause a cake to become dense and heavy, making it difficult to stack.
Brownies, however, are sheet pan cakes and this is perfectly fine.

### Cakey Brownie Ratio

Ingredient | Baker's %
|-|-:|
Flour | 100
Fat | 190
Eggs | 166
Sugar | 333
Cocoa | 50

## Fudgy

Fudgy brownies have a higher fat:flour ratio.
In the range of ~3 times more fat than a chocolate cake recipe.
This significantly weighs it down and gives it the characteristic fudge texture.

Fat can come in the form of butter, chocolate chips, oil, or egg yolks.

### Fudgy Brownie Ratio

Ingredient | Baker's %
|-|-:|
Flour | 100
Fat | 325
Eggs | 140
Chocolate chip | 160
Sugar | 285

## Chewy

*NOTE*: there's ambiguity between the understanding of chewy and fudgy classifiers.
For the sake of discussion, fudgy is like fudge or molten lava cake.
Chewy is akin to a cookie instead of a cake.

Chewy brownies can be thought of as moving closer to cookies.
They are achieved by reducing flour ratio in a chocolate cake recipe.
Compared to fudgy brownies, they have lower fat ratio and higher sugar ratio.

Fat tenderizes (opposite of chew) and flour gives structure (cakey).

### Chewy Brownie Ratio

Ingredient | Baker's %
|-|-:|
Flour | 100
Fat | 135
Eggs | 125
Sugar | 330
Cocoa | 50

## General Rule of Thumb on Ratios

In general, manipulating the ratios is what differentiates cakey, fudgy, and chewy brownies.

- Increasing the ratio of fat moves a brownie towards fudgy.
- Increasing the ratio of flour moves a brownie towards chewy.
  - More flour to chocolate cake makes a chewy brownie.
  - More flour to a fudgy brownie makes a decadent, _devil's food_ cake (gives a bit of structure back).
- Increasing the ratio of sugar moves a brownie towards cakey.
