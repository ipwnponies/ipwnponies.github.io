## Definition

Base form of verbs are the ones we learn about in school: _eat_, _want_, _talk_.

The infinitive forms of these verbs prepend "to" in front: _to eat_, _to want_, _to talk_.
Infinitives are a type of **verbal**, which are verbs used as an adjective, noun, or adverb.
The other verbals are gerunds (_am talking_) and participles (_talking dog_).

## Usage

Infinitives can be used as a noun, adjective, or adverb.

Infinitives can be the _object_: "[I] [want] [to be] [an astronaut]".
The subject is _I_, the verb is _want_, and the object is the infinitive _to be_.
The adjective is _an astronaut_.

Infinitive are used after adjectives to clarify meaning: "[Shane] [is] [too full] [to have] [another burger]".
The subject is _Shane_, the verb is _is_, and the object is _another burger_.
The adjective is _too full_ and the infinitive is _to have_.

## Why Is This Relevant

Verbs in Spanish have different conjugations, depending on the pronoun.
They generally follow consistent rules.
It seems that people use the infinitive as the "base form" for discussion.
From there, you pick the correct conjugation for your sentence.
