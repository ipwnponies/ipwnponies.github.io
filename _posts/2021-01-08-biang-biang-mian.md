I followed [Chinese Cooking Demystified][reddit] and it's always a great read.
They talk about the history and cultural aspects, whose context helps to frame how the dish evolved and what limitations
they were developed under.
The techniques are broken down into great detail, to help non-chinese understand the nuances of Chinese cookery.

## History

Biang biang noodles are from the the Northwest of China, in the province of Shaanxi.
It came into popular culture due to _Xi'an Famous Foods_, which is a popular chain in New York.

[Shaanxi cuisine][shaanxi] is known for noodles and lamb dishes.
They makes use of strong, assertive flavours (salt, savoury, oily).
This is in contrast to Cantonese cuisine, which is sweeter and less spicy.

## Chinese Character

The character for _biang_ is incredibly complicated.
It's an onomatopoeia for the sound of the noodles smashing against the table when being slapped and pulled.

## Dish Characteristic

These noodles are hand-pulled.
This requires the dough to be elastic (gluten development) and extensible (pliable).
To make this happen without dough conditioners, we utilized long rest times to allow the gluten to fully relax.

To flavour the dish, it is topped with spices and hot oil is poured over top.
The hot oil blooms the spices.
Sichuan peppercorns and chili flakes are good spices to start the dish with but you can tweak this as desired:

- cumin to go with shredded lamb
- poultry seasoning and poached chicken, for a fusion
- paprika and espresso/cocoa with beef
