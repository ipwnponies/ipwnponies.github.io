La Jolla is a neighbourhood in San Diego.
But you can see addresses that seem to say otherwise.

For example, Birch Aquarium is located at

> 2300 Expedition Way
>
> La Jolla, CA 92037

This is because it's been [deemed a special community of regional significance][1].

> Due to its importance as a visitor destination, La Jolla has been designated as a special community of regional
> and state-wide significance by the California Coastal Act.

So... people should stop pretending it's a different city.
It's classist and petty.
Or continue but know that our eyes can only roll so hard ðŸ™„.
