Chocolate mayo cake is an well-kept secret.
It works really, really well.

Mayo is comprised of oil, egg, and some acid.
The primary components are the same as for chocolate cakes, especially those where you want fudgy texture.
So it's not far-fetched for the plausibility of this ingredient combination.

This cake whips together in seconds and cooks real fast, making it a great candidate for a late-night snack.
Its use of mayo means you can use the right amount needed, and not need to sacrifice or substitute the egg portion of a
cake recipe.

Besides chocolate cake, there doesn't seem to be other common recipes that use mayo.
I searched "mayo cake -chocolate" and didn't get any results.
I'm not sure why chocolate is the only one but I wonder if the bitterness of the cocoa balances against the mayo flavour.
