When I made [prime rib][1] for the holidays, I served it with a chimichurri sauce.
With the fond, I made some au jus.
This served as the base for the beef broth.

I've had caramelized onions in the freezer and this seemed like a great, synergistic way to use the two.
If you have the ingredients on-hand or in some prepared version, the assembly and cooking of the soup turns out to be trivial.
The pain in making french onion soup is all the prep work (beef broth and caramelized onions), which can be prepared
beforehand for other uses.
