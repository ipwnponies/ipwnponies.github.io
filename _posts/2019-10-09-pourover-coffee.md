There are several popular methods for pourover coffee, with the Hario V60.
I'm going to try them out over the next few weeks and see how they work.

# Scott Rao Method

This [method][1] is the simplest.
It's bloom + single pour.

It also includes the use of the ["Rao Spin"][2], a gentle swirl to keep the grounds turbulent and off the side walls of
the cone.

|-|-|
| Ratio | 1:15 |
| Coffee for 200 ml cup | 13 g |
| Brew Time | 3:00 |

1. Bloom with 40 g of water.
    Gently stir to ensure all grounds are moisten.
1. At 00:45, pour 160 g water.
    Gently stir.
1. At 1:45, perform the ["Rao Spin"][2], gently swirling the V60 2-3 times.
1. The pour should drain by 3:00.

# Matt Perger Method

This [method][3] is a bloom and 2 pulse pours.
It also includes use of a spoon to stir the mixture after pours.
He also recommends a light tap to settle the grounds evenly.

|-|-|
| Ratio | 1:15 |
| Coffee for 200 ml cup | 13 g |
| Brew Time | 2:20 |

1. Bloom with 50 g (25%).
1. At 00:30, pour another 50 g (25%).
1. At 1:00, pour remaining 100 g.
1. The pour should drain by 2:20.

# Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 Method

This [method][4] is 5 pulse pours.
Each pour is timed to completely drain by the next pour.
So the first pour serves as a bloom.

The proportions of first two pours (40%) will target acidity:

- a smaller initial bloom will have higher overall extraction (bitter)
- a higher bloom delay extraction, resulting in less extraction (acidic)

The remaining 60% is split into multiple even pours, between 4-6.
The number of pours will increase strength (extraction)

This is a systematic and repeatable method for extraction.
But there's no scientific basis behind this, other than extraction theory.

It requires a coarser grind (french press) since the multiple pours increase extraction.

| Ratio | 1:15 |
| Coffee for 200 ml cup | 13 g |
| Brew Time | 3:30 |

4 | 4 | 6 | 6 | 6
-|-|-|-|-
50 | 70 | 60 | 60 | 60

1. Pour amount for stage.
1. Within 45 seconds, the pour should have drained.
  If not, adjust grind.
1. Repeat for each stage.
1. Brew should complete in 3:30.

# Summary

All methods are manipulating number of pours and how much water goes into each.
They still aim for even extraction, having the grounds be evenly immersed in water for the same amount of time.

Some use techniques such as the swirl or tap to encourage grounds to remain evenly distributed in the solution.

Increase temperature or grind finer to increase extraction.
Increase the concentration gradient with the use of pulse pours and waiting for full drainage.
