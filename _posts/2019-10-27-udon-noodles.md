Making udon noodles from scratch is surprisingly easy.
It's very similar to [ramen noodles][1] in hydration, although the characteristics of the dough change how you handle it.

## Ramen

Ramen dough has the inclusion of a base (sodium carbonate) which increases the dough's strength.
This is what contributes to the "bounce" in the bite.
This strength allows the dough to be rolled very thin.
It's also means that the noodles should be cut thin, otherwise they would be too firm and chewy.

## Udon

Udon noodles are also 45% hydration dough.
There can be a mix of tapioca starch, which increases the elasticity and softens the dough.
Because there is now pH modification, the dough requires a more standard, long rest (>3 hours) to fully hydrate and relax.

When cooked, the noodles are softer and therefore should be cut wider for more interesting texture.
I'm not sure what would happen if the dough were to be rolled thin, it might end up mushy or without a desirable texture.

## Tapioca Starch

Tapioca starch is not traditional but it's common to see in other cultures that have adopted udon
(Vietnamese banh canh, for example).
Tapioca gives the dough a smoother and chewiness, without making the noodles gummier when cooked.
30% is a good percentage to start, maybe experiment with more until the desired texture is found.
