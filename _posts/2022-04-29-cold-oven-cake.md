There's a style of pound cakes that are not baked in a preheated oven.
It's basically a pound cake with half as much baking powder.
Here's a recipe from [epicurious][1] and [joyofbaking][2], for comparison.

The idea is:

- cake will slowly come up to temperature, as the oven preheats
- crust will take more time to set, allowing the rest of the cake the opportunity to expand
- slow rise will cause bubbles to expand more gently and uniformly, producing a tight crumb
- crust will spend more time in the oven, drying out and getting crisper

I tried baking it and can confirm that it will bake up.
Personally, I'm not a fan of this and I feel like I may not be using it to its strengths.
The texture was very tight and dense:
it looks under-baked and gummy but it's completely cooked.
I think this tight crumb may allow serving it in a different style, perhaps with some fruit compote or jam.
Or maybe a glaze or syrup.
