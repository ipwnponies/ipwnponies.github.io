I discovered this delicious dish from Blue Apron.
They call it [Beef Over Curry Spiced Rice][1].
What makes this recipe very appealing is the simplicity of the dish.
The ingredients are not esoteric and there's little preparation.

## Name

I'm struggling to find an appropriate name for this dish though.

It shares similarities with chili, a stew made with ground beef and tomatoes.
However, chili has more sauce and is hearty, meant to be eaten on its own.

It's similar to ragu, a sauce made with ground beef and tomatoes.
It shares similar flavourings in terms of spices and herbs.
However, this dish is much drier and will not provide enough sauce for pasta.

It's not a curry stew for similar reasons as ragu.
Curry stews would be cousins to ragu or chili but with different flavours and ingredients.

I think the closest I can come up with is a [skillet hash][2].
The name _hash_ comes from the French word _hacher_ (to chop).
It's a dish that uses up leftovers and the ingredients are chopped up and cooked together.

## Serving

This is served with curried rice in the Blue Apron recipe.
The seasoned rice pairs very well with the flavours in the beef hash.

These could probably be served over mashed potatoes.
The smooth texture and mild flavour would be a good pairing to the beef hash's texture and spiced flavour.

I can also imagine serving this alongside roast or stewed vegetables.

When serving, this would benefit from a creamy sauce.
It also benefits from fresh herbs for garnish.
These elements can be combined together in a creamy cilantro sauce.

Nothing too flavourful or tangy, like ranch.
That would detract from the flavours.
What we want is something cooling and brining freshness to the spices.
