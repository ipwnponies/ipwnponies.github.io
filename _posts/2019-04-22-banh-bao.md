I took another stab at making banh bao again.
This time, I made filled buns using egg and ground turkey.

Some things I tweaked this time around:

* Less yeast, to avoid proofing too quickly
* Steaming for less time
* Steaming at full boil

The results are better than the last time.
The dough was able to keep its shape after baking.
I think the bao I made were smaller than recipes expected and the steam times they gave were too much.

I'll definitely keep trying these, now that I'm getting the hang of it.
It's an easy way to package a complete meal that's portable and ready to go.
