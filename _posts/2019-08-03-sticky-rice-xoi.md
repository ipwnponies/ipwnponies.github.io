I ended up with a bit of leftover coconut milk, from a previous recipe.
I could have made che but then I would need to get more ingredients (beans, agar agar, jelly).
I decided to try making sweet sticky rice (xoi), which is a simple and adaptable recipe.

The version I made is sweet and creamy xoi.
This is considered a dessert or snack item, as opposed to savoury xoi.
The recipe I followed served as a base:
making xoi is like making ice cream base, it's easy to switch up the flavourings and toppings.

In fact, I didn't have pandan extract.
Or durian.
Or coconut.
I used vanilla extract and it turned out quite well.

And I didn't have peanuts for topping.
Instead, I crushed some pretzel sticks and it turned to be a decent textural substitute.
But there is a lack of nuttiness, maybe toasted sesame or hemp seeds can be used for this.

I used 240 g of glutinous rice, 140 g of coconut milk, and 60 g of water.
This water ratio ended up being a little more than desired, so I'd probably drop down by 20-30 g of liquid.
I also found it to be pleasantly coconut-flavoured but next time I would try reducing the coconut milk used by 25%.
