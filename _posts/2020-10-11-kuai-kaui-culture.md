There's a unique practice in Taiwan of placing green snack bags on top of electronics.
This is [Kuai Kuai][wiki], a regional and modern superstition (earliest documented case in 2008).
It's common in the IT industry and has been expanding to other industries.

*Kuai kuai* translates to *obedient* or *well-behaved* the hope is to ensure systems are well-behaved and continue operating.
It's limited to the workplace and can be found on many different types of machines:

- server rooms
- ATMs
- vending machines

There's a food snack company called Kuai Kuai that started in 1968.
They produce snacks such as cookies or puffed corn.
Their puffed corn comes in a green bag and has been used as the product of choice, because of the company name and the
bag colour.

There are a few conventions surrounding kuai kuai:

- the snack should not be expired. I presume deities would be offended by your half-hearted offerings
- the bag needs inspected occasionally for damage. Presumably, nobody wants surprise pests near these systems.
- you shouldn't mess around or eat the snack. It's an offering, duh.
- colours are significant: green is for electronics, yellow is for finance (gold and riches), and red is for romance
