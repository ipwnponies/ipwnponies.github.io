A sugar glaze is a simple glaze comprising of powdered sugar and liquid.
It's used for glazing donuts, muffins, coffee cakes, pastries, etc.

Use this glaze where you want a thin film of sweetness, something that accentuates the
existing textures of the underlying bake.
Use a frosting instead if you want to mask the underlying texture altogether, such as in a cake.

## Tips

This glaze is effectively just hydrated sugar.
We hydrate enough to pour and spread.
Then the glaze is allowed to set, by drying out the surface moisture.
As such, humidity control is key to extending the shelf-life of this glaze.

Because of the simplicity of this glaze, consider glazing product on day of consumption.
This allows for freezing bakes without glazing.

Fat is optionally added to the glaze to increase pliability and softness of the glaze.
Adding it will give a glaze like on top of chocolate ring donuts.
Not adding it will give a crisper glaze, such as glazed donut.
