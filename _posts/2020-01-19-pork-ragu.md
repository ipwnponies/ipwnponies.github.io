I recently discovered that you can make ragu with different meats.
I also thought bolognese, with ground beef, was the most common and preferred way.
When I discovered pork ragu, it felt like a perfect match for pork shoulder (my favourite cut) and pressure cooking.

Pressure cooking reduces cooking time from 3+ hours to 1 hour and is completely hands-off.
The result is a dish ragu that accentuates the tomato and spice flavours more so than bolognese.
The collagen from pork shoulder or rib tips adds a lot of body to the sauce.

At the end of the cooking process, the rendered fat will rise to the surface as a separate layer.
This is because pressure cooking is a gentle process, with little agitation.
All it takes a rapid boil to emulsify the sauce.
The abundance of collagen easily emulsifies the fat into a thick, luxurious sauce.
