title: Vim redir command
---

# Story
I was filing a bug on YouCompleteMe vim plugin and they request the output of `:YcmDebugInfo`.
This command dumps output onto terminal and I can use my terminal emulator features to copy (iTerm2).

But what if the dump was much longer and displayed by the `more` pager?
Surely there must be a way to dump this to a file?

# redir
Enter `:redir`.
It's how redirection to a variable, register, or file is done.
The more common user of this would be vimscripts, where you might want to dump debugging information.

```vim
redir > ycm_debug_info.txt
:YcmDebugInfo
redir END
```
This will redirect the vim's `stdout` equivalent to a file.
From there, I could `pbcopy` and paste it into the github issue.

# Uses
I think this knowledge is more compelling to me to dump the output of `:ALEInfo`.
Then I could `grep`, filter, and view this in `less`.
Sure we could make the logs nicer but there's only so much effort that can be put into formatting `:ALEInfo` output
before you're spending too much time on side of the equation.
