I made some che dau xanh and was surprised how simple it is.
I was inspired to make this dish after reading this [recipe from runawayrice][1].
It's a simple pudding with the following elements:

- tapioca starch for viscosity
- mung beans for flavour and texture
- coconut milk and sugar, classic Vietnamese dessert elements

# Tips

- When cooking mung beans, minimize the water used and reserve for cooking the sauce.
    I discovered it packs a lot of flavour!
- Be conservative if first time using tapioca starch.
    I've used cornstarch before and it felt that tapioca was a bit more powerful than I predicted
- Cooking times for mung bean in instant pot is 15 minutes on high. I'll experiment with reducing this to maybe 13
    minutes to target more al dente.
