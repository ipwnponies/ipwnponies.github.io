The spanish *A* preposition was tricky for me to understand at first.
It translates to the English *to*/*at* preposition.
The reason it's tricky is that Spanish grammar does not always translate to English.

But otherwise, most of the other prepositions have matched the English translation so far.
e.g. *con*, *de*, *en*, *sobre*.

## Definition

*A* means *to* or *at*.
It's a [preposition][1] which establishes relationship of a noun.
In this example, it's the object in a subject-verb-object agreement.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition

> I say hi **to** ipwnponies

The subject is *I*, the verb is *say hi* and the object is *ipwnponies*.
The preposition *to* is establishing a relationship to the object.
In this example, it disambiguates the between other prepositions.
i.e. "I say hi **like** ipwnponies"

The relationship changed from *ipwnponies* receiving the words to the statement
bearing a resemblance in speech mannerisms.

## How to Use

The common use is very straightforward substitution.

> Nosotros vamos *a* la escuela
>
> We go **to** \[the] school

## Tricky Example

Why is *A* tricky?
It's because many verbs in Spanish don't match English subject-verb order.

> **a mi** me gusta el pastel de chocolate.
>
> **to me**, it pleases me, chocolate cake (transliteration).
>
> chocolate cake pleases me (awkward but grammatically correct english).

That is, *me gusta* does not mean *I like* but closer to *it pleases me*.
When you understand the use of the verb, then the *a* is no longer tricky.
You were bamboozled by the incorrect translation and understanding of what is the subject and what is the object.

We can see this happend for *de*.
In English, we just say *ipwnponies' blog* but in Spanish it would be *blog de ipwnponies*.
In awkward but grammatically correct English, this is *the blog of/belonging to ipwnponies*.

Or a *ham sandwich* becomes a *sandwich of ham* (*sándwich de jamón*).
