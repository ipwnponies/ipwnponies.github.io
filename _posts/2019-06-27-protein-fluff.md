Protein fluff is magical food when it comes to a cut.
It's highly filling and has great macros.

At it's simplest, it can be made with protein powder and can of pop.
Mix them together and whisk until aerated.
The result is a boatload of air and protein powder.
This is extremely filling and very high in protein.

In terms of taste, it's acceptable: I'm not going to miss having protein fluff during a bulk but it tastes good enough
that I won't hate myself if eating it daily.
