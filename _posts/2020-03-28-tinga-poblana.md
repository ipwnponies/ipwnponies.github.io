Tinga de pollo (chicken tinga) is a mexican dish that is composed of shredded chicken in a spicy, tomato-based stew.
A similar dish made with pork exists called *Tinga Poblana*.
Once cooked, the meat and sauce can be used as fillings for many things:

- tamales
- tacos
- empanadas
- burritos
- tortas

The main flavour components are tomatoes and chipotle peppers (in adobo sauce).
The general flow is:

1. Brown meat.
1. Sweat alliums.
1. Bloom spices.
1. Deglaze with tomatoes, whether fresh or canned.
1. Add blended chipotle peppers and adobo sauce.
1. Add meat back.
1. Simmer until meat is cooked.
1. Shred meat and serve.

I serve this inside tacos, made the fresh corn tortillas.
I've updated the roti/tortilla recipe to include a section for corn tortilla.
The key learning was to capture a ratio, instead of volumetric recipes online.
