I've used this cake pan conversation chart at [Sally's Baking Addiction][1] to scale recipes.
Sometimes a recipe is written for a loaf pan but I want to use a bundt pan and need to know if how much to scale the recipe.

I've recalculated the ratios (to sanity check) and to match my commonly used pan sizes.
Note that these are max capacities.
In practice, we're only interested in the order of magnitude.
We would want to scale the recipe by integer amounts, for convenience.
Just don't want too shallow or deep of a pan.

Pan | Volume | Ratio
- | -: | -:
Round 8" | 1.5 L | 100%
Square 9" | 2.6 L | 170%
Rectangular 9" x 13" | 3.5 L | 230%
Bundt 9" | 2.4 L | 160%
Loaf pan 8.5" x 4.5" | 1.5 L | 100%
