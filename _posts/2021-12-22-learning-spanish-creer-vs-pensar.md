The Spanish verbs _creer_ and _pensar_ may be confusing to English speakers, upon reading the dictionary definition.

_Pensar_ means [_to think_][1] and _creer_ means [_to believe_][2].
In English, _think_ is overloaded with both connotations:

> I think that could be fun.
>
> I think about morning coffee, while I wait for the bus.
>
> I believe you're right.
>
> I believe in Bigfoot.

In English, _think_ can either mean:

1. Hold a belief or opinion, to suppose.
1. Use the mind to process ideas or to reflect.

Very often, when we say "I think X", we are _supposing_ (creer).
There's no actual thinking process involved, it's a belief that is already being held.

Less frequently, we mean to reflect, such as "I need to think this over" (pensar).
There is actual thinking involved and this takes time.

These semantics carry over to spanish but their verbs have stronger delineation.
These two verbs are strongly relatedly, explaining why it's overloaded: the result of a thinking session can form a new belief.
With this understanding, you can expect to use _creer_ much more frequently.
Unless you're some kind of philosopher or perpetually in another state of mind ðŸ¤ª.

## Mnemonic

_Creer_ means _to believe_ that something has **cre**dence.

_Pensar_ means _to reflect_ and be in a **pen**sive state.
