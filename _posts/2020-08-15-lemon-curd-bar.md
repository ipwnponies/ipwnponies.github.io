Lemon desserts are a novel treat for me.
I'm beginning to develop a palate for them.
The zest imparts a ton of bright, floral flavour.
The juice is a flavourful acid that can be used to react with baking soda.

I made lemon curd and filled small tarts.
These are are delectable.

## Curds and Custards

I'm not sure the difference between a curd and custard.
The term *curd* comes from curdling of diary when an acid is introduced, such as when making cheese.
I think *custards* are a subset of *curds*, where it's a thickened mixture of milk/cream and eggs.
And when we talk about curds, specifically fruit curds, we're talking about the thickening of eggs and acidic fruits.
