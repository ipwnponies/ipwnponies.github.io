Rolling a burrito is surprisingly very tricky.
Those guys rolling burritos in 2 seconds flat?
They're skilled artisans.

I watched a [video with a ridiculously skilled burrito roller][1].
It's mesmerizing.
It's one of those things that seems deceptively trivial.

## Technique

1. Fold tortilla inwards with 'V' shape.
1. Fold the center over the top of the fillings.
1. Drag back to neatly pack the fillings.
  Be careful not to squeeze the fillings, we're only packing for organization.
1. Fold the sides inwards and pleat.
1. Finish rolling.

## Tips

- Don't overfill.
  It's tempting to do but you need the extra slack in order to roll into a stable structure.
- Pack fillings into tube shape.
  This gives the burrito rigidity
- Wrap with parchment or tin foil.
  This is optional but provides additional rigidity, making up for poor rolling technique.
