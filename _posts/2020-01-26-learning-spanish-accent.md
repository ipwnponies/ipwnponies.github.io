I'm trying to learn Spanish through Duolingo and I figure it might be fun to write about a few of the lessons or fun
facts I learn about the language.

Today, we're going to start off with the pronunciation of the consonant _J_.

## Examples

Spanish | English
-|-
jugo | juice
jamon | ham
jaja | haha

The last example explains the meme of Brazilian gamers in online gaming.
They regularly employ this in place of _lol_, as the onomatopoeia for human laughter.

## Linguistic Elements

_J_ is a ["voiceless velar fricative"][1].
I'm going to try to to break this down to better understand the pronunciation.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_velar_fricative

**Voiceless** means it does not use the vocal chords.
A good example is to compare _z_ and _s_ in English.
It's difficult to pronounce _z_ while whispering, it ends up being identical to _s_.
Whispering does not use vocal chords.

A **fricative** consonant is where air is forcefully expelled.
Think consonants where you can hiss: _s_, _f_, _z_, and _k_ in English.

**Velar** means the sound is produced towards the back part of the mouth.
_g_ in "get" is an example of a velar consonant in English.

In some regional dialects, _J_ is a glottal consonant.
**Glottal** consonants are produced in the throat (farther back).
_h_ in "hop" is a glottal consonant in English.

With all these elements together, it produces a sound that is like the _k_ in book for English.
For Vietnamese speakers, it is the _kh_ sound in "kh√¥ng".

## Practical application

It's difficult to get 100% accuracy because languages evolve and differ by region.
There's never a "correct" pronunciation other than "deviating less" from the norm among the general population.

For general speakers, substituting _j_ directly for _h_ sound in English will be correctly understood by native speakers.
For more precise pronunciation, you'd want to aim for _h_ in _Hugh_ or _huh_, rather than _h_ in _hi_.
