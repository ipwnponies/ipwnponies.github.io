Another summer and it's another season of tomatoes.
[Every year][previous-post] I try to get in on the tomato season and this also means making BLTs and tomato
sandwiches, which use white sandwich bread.

This year, I tried using a recipe from [The Perfect Loaf][perfect-loaf].
This is a white sandwich bread that uses tangzhong component and sourdough starter.

It's the same ratios as [my recipe][white-bread-recipe] but with 15% more hydration.
I'm going to be shifting the recipe in that direction, as this loaf is plump and rose to teh correct height for my
loaf pan (previous recipe did not rise over the top of pan).
