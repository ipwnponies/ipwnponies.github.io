I know a manager that brings croissants to the office weekly, for his team's standup.
I've been invited to attend these a couple times and they start out very casual, like a social/communal breakfast.
It's held first thing in the morning, after the later folks stroll in.
Usually it's very informal, just a social gathering of the team, a way to slowly get the day started.
Then the stand-up happens very quickly and effectively.

I asked the manager how he got the inspiration for this.
Turns out, it's a work culture thing in France and has a name: [chouqette meetings][2].

# Chouqette

A [_chouquette_][1] is choux pastry, sprinkled with large sugar crystals.
It's shaped like small, round biscuits.
They're simple to make and are a cheap pastry that is available at any patisserie.
The easy access, low cost, and widespread appeal makes them analogous to muffins or donuts, in American work culture.

# Chouquette Meetings

In France, it's common to bring in chouquette for coworkers to announce life occasions.
But managers in the workplace also commonly bring in chouquettes, as a way to engage coworkers for meetings.
In that regard, it's very similar to bringing cookies, donuts, or muffins to meetings.

This is because the team-wide meetings tend to be for the benefit of the manager, not the individual team members.
Using this as an incentive and tool of appreciation.
