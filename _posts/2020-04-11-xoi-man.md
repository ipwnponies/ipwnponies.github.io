One of my mom's favourite dishes is xôi mặn, a low brow, comfort Vietnamese food.
It's a savoury, glutinous rice dish that can be topped with a variety of toppings.
Like a casserole, it's a template and vessel for consolidating whatever leftovers you have lying around.

The base components are:

- sticky rice
- soy sauce
- choice of toppings
- green onion oil

And it's very easy and hands-off to make.
The ingredients are mostly shelf-stable pantry items, making this a great dish to keep in your back pocket.
