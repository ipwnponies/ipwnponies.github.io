I've been practicing with yeasted doughs and cinnamon rolls have been my most consistent bake.
I use the recipe and technique from *King Arthur's*.
But I picked up a handy trick from *SeriousEats*: instead of spreading melted butter and sprinkling on cinnamon sugar,
make a buttercream frosting instead.
It's easily spreadable (it's frosting after all) and allows for smooth, even coverage across the entire surface.

The two techniques have led to pretty consistent, delicious results.
