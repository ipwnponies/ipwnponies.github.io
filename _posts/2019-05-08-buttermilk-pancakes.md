I've been trying to figure out how to use up buttermilk.
I made [Texas sheet cake] from SeriousEats but it didn't stand out to me.
I also tried making [buttermilk biscuits] but the ratio was off, so the result is inconclusive.

But then I discovered [buttermilk pancakes].
This. Is. My. Jam.

These are some seriously fluffy pancakes.
They use up quite a bit of buttermilk too, which helped in that respect.
