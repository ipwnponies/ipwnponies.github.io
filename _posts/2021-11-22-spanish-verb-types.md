There are a [few different verb types in Spanish][1]: transitive, intransitive, reflexive, reciprocal.
Learning these grammar constructs can be very helpful in understanding how to properly use them, as they don't have
direct analogs in English.

## Transitive

Transitive verbs are **verbs that need a direct object**.

The test is to determine the direct object is to ask \<verb> who/what.

> I eat _a cookie_
>
> Como _una galleta_

Sometimes the _a_ is needed if the direct object is a person or place.

> You meet Joey.
>
> Conoces _a Joey_

## Intransitive

Intransitive verbs are **verbs that don't need a direct object**.
Along with verb conjugation, which incorporates the subject, it's common for intransitive verbs to form one word sentences.

> I sleep
>
> Duermo

Other times, there may be an indirect object, which is specified through pronouns.

> Chocolate is pleasing to me
>
> El chocolate me gusta

In this example, the indirect object is _me_.
This sentence translates to _chocolate is pleasing to me_.

## Pronominal

Pronominal verbs are _reflexive_ and _reciprocal_ verbs.
These require object pronouns to specify what the indirect object is.

| Pronoun  | Reflexive |
| -------- | --------- |
| yo       | me        |
| tu       | te        |
| el/ella  | se        |
| nosotros | nos       |

### Reflexive

Reflexive verbs are verbs where the action is performed on oneself.
These are very common in Spanish and almost entirely absent from English.

> I have to wash the fruit: _tengo que lavar la fruta_
>
> I have to wash myself: _tengo que lavarme_

A test is if this English translation involves _myself_, _yourself_, or _himself_.

The infinitive verb form of a reflexive verb appends _-se_.
i.e. _lavar_ becomes _lavarse_.

Reflexive verbs can also be transitive/normal verbs.
This is as simple as changing the object pronoun to a second person.

> Me llamo Alberto
>
> Mi amigos me llaman Alberto

The first sentence is reflexive because it's translated as "I call _myself_ Alberto".
The second sentence is transitive because it's translated as "My friends call _me_ Alberto".
We can see that there's a significant difference in English; however, in Spanish, it's just verb conjugation and pronoun
agreement, otherwise there's nothing special about reflexive verbs.

### Reciprocal

Reciprocal verbs are verbs where the action is performed between two subjects, to each other.
It's the same idea as reflexive verbs but there are two subjects.

> We hug each other
>
> Nos abrazamos

A rough test is if the English translation involves _each other_.
This can be extraneous and implied, such as in _we hug (each other)_.

To be honest, this distinction seems to be a linguistic technicality.
In practice, the reflexive and reciprocal forms seem mutually exclusive and intuitively distinct.
e.g. for the verb _abrazar_, it's assumed to be reciprocal instead of reflexive, as there are inherently two subjects and
no one is hugging themselves.
This might explain why _reflexive_ verbs are conflated with being both pronominal and reciprocal verbs.
