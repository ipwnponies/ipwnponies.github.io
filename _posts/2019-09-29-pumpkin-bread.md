It's fall and that means pumpkin season.
We get bombarded with pumpkin bakes and pumpkin spice, so I made some pumpkin bread to get in on the fun.

# Recipe I tried

I followed a recipe from [onceuponachef][1] but the texture didn't turn out the way I would have liked.
I found it to be very moist and dense, lacking texture.
In comparing it to other pumpkin bread recipes, it has roughly 2x the baker's percent of canned pumpkin.

It wasn't bad at all.
But it did taste like bakes made when doing fat substitution with applesauce.

# Alternate Recipe

Next time I would want to try a recipe that's more like [this one from joyofbaking][2].
It has more flour and egg, and less butter and sugar.
This should have more structure and more closely resemble a quickbread instead of a cake.

When compared against [Bon Appetit's Banana Bread][3], it has similar ratios except twice the fat.
But that banana bread recipe is known as an outlier in its class, a low-fat variant that is sort of like a sponge cake.

# Pumpkin Bread vs. Banana Bread

When you really sit down and think about it, what's the difference between banana bread and pumpkin bread?
They're both quickbreads that are spiced similarly.

I think it might be possible to use a banana bread recipe and substitute the mashed banana for equivalent amount of
canned pumpkin.
And make the necessary modification for flavour pairings, although I can't think of any incompatible flavour pairings
among the common ingredients used in both recipes.
