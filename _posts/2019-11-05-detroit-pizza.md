Detroit-style pizza is a type of pizza that's baked in a square dish pan.
It has the following characteristics:

* Thick and light crust
* Toppings all the way to the edge of the pan
* Cheese is purposefully placed right up to the edge, where it will caramelize and become crispy
* Crispy, fried crust

# Layering

Detroit pizza can commonly defer conventional pizza layering.
The order, from bottom to crust, goes:

1. Cheese
1. Meat
1. Sauce
1. Optional additional meat or cheese

The benefit of layering cheese directly on the dough is to form a water-proof layer.
This prevents the sauce from making the dough soggy.

Sometimes, the sauce is cooked, it's simply added on at the end.
From what I understand, there's no defining tradition here.
Withholding sauce from baking seems to practical decision, to reduce the moisture that slows the baking speed.

# Origin

The apocryphal origins is that the pan used was originally automotive industrial parts tray.

It's derived form *Sicilian/Grandma* styles of pizza.
Sicilian pizza, in turn, is related to focaccia.
So it inherits all the characteristics of a foccacia dough:

* high hydration, slack dough
* shaped and cooked in greased pan
* no-knead, open crumb

# Is it Deep-Dish

Detroit-style pizza is a variant of "pan pizza", pizzas baked in a pan (cake).
The pizza bakes up in the shape of the pan, rising up against the wall of the pan.

This is in contrast to pizzas baked on a flat surface (flatbread).
These pizzas baked directly on a pizza stone, baking steel, or baking sheet.

Chicago deep-dish is baked in a cake tin (pie).
This shares traits with hot water crust pie, with high walls and lots of filling.
Deep-dish pizza has thinner crust than detroit-style pizza would.
