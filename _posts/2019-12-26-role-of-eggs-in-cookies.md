Eggs tenderize a cookie by providing fat (yolk).
It helps a cookie to spread by adding liquid (egg white).

## Creamed cookies

These are cookie recipes that start with cold butter, that is creamed with sugar until light and fluffy.
These start off on the cakey end of the cookie spectrum.

### Yolks for creamed cookies

Yolks have emulsifiers that assist in creaming.
This aerates the dough better and can help to move the cookie towards cakey.

### Whites for creamed cookies

Egg whites add more moisture to a cookie.
They do not aerate well but sufficient whites will introduce enough liquid for steaming.
This results in a moist, dense, and chewy cookie.

An egg white-only cookie will not have yolk which adds flavour.
As a result, the underlying flavours will come through better instead of being muddled.

## Whipped eggs cookies

This cookies typically use melted butter or liquid fats.
The dough is made by mixing eggs with sugar, with or without focus on aeration.
These start off on the chewy end of the cookie spectrum.

### Yolks for non-creamed cookies

Yolks increase fat and inhibit gluten, which makes a cookie more tender, fudgey and dense.

### Whites for non-creamed cookies

Whites trap more air while beating and provide moisture.
This will make the cookie tall and fluffy.
