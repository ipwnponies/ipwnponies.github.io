Customarily, sticky rice is steamed instead of boiled, have firm, unbroken grains.
This is done with a bamboo steamer, which is permeable to steam but doesn't allow rice grains to fall through.
With a conventional steel pot with steamer insert, the holes are too large.
Parchment paper or cheesecloth can be used to line the bottom for steaming.

I found a new technique for steaming sticky rice that I want to try out.
It uses those splatter guards, with their fine mesh acting as permeable cover.
This [blog article][1] covers it in better detail than I can.

Bamboo steamers are uni-taskers and take up a lot of space.
They also require a bit of care to maintain and clean up.

The splatter guard allows for uniform steam distribution and it can work with any pot or pan.
All you need is a saut√© pan (or pot) and a metal or glass bowl to serve as a cover.
It ends up looking like some sort of tagine.
