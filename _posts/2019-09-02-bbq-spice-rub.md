I've using this spice rub for years, ever since I discovered it on amazingribs.com.
It's balanced in spicy, sweet, and aromatic.

The full recipe is for 24 slabs of ribs but that is more ribs than I eat in years.
Also, volume measurements are annoying to use.
So I took the time to convert and scale down the recipe for 2 slabs.
I figure this would be easy enough to either double up (for making a batch) or to halve (single serving of ribs).
