I tried my hand at making hotdog buns, following the [foodwishes recipe][1].

## Review of Recipe

The dough can also be used to make hamburger buns, if shaped differently.
This is light brioche bun that is common on gourmet burgers.

The flavour is slightly sweet, just like white bread.
But the addition of eggs gives it a rich, sweetness, like Asian milk breads.

The texture is phenomenal, it's super light and soft.
And this didn't need that much kneading.
I think it's the result of the eggs and gentle handling, when shaping.
