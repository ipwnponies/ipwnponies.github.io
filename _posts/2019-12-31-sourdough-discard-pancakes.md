## Sourdough Discard

If you maintain a starter, then you're familiar with the continual need to "feed the starter".
This is where you provide the starter with fresh flour to keep the cultures active.
To keep the starter size under control, a portion of the unfed starter is discarded.

Sourdough discard is best used in recipes where you want sourdough flavour and do not need leavening.
They're commonly found in recipes such as: pancakes, waffles, quickbreads, crackers, pizza.

## Pancakes

Pancakes are a great way to use sourdough discard.

The acidity of the starter reacts with baking soda to leaven the batter.

The high hydration starter works well for pancake batter, whereas other baked goods would require additional flour,
making this a highly efficient recipe to use up discard.
Nothing is worse than trying to use up an ingredient and introducing 3 more ingredients that are perishable as well.
