The spanish words for *this* and *that* are confusing.
Here's a rhyming mnemonic to help you out:

> This and these have t's
>
> That and those have so's

*t's* and *so's* have english long vowel form pronunciations, *tees* and *soes*.

English | EspaÃ±ol Masculine | EspaÃ±ol Feminine
-|-|-
this (singlular)|este|esta
these (plural)|estes|estas
that|ese|esa
those|esos|esas

When referring to an idea, use the neutral pronoun *eso*.
It's roughly translated to *that one thing/*.

> Eso es inteligente
> (that [idea/thinking] is smart)
