I baked a pull-apart bread, which is like a different structure to a cinnamon roll.

You know how cinnamon rolls uncurl and it's fun to eat?
This is what you get if that's the only way to eat it.

I also learned that you can add apples to a cinnamon roll.
I'm going to continue to experiment with this and see if it's a fun addition to add some bulk to these pastries.
