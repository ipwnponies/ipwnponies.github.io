[Clafoutis][1] is a baked dessert that resembles a flan.
It's traditionally filled with berries.
It's served warm, with whipped cream or powdered sugar.
I learned of this dish from [SeriousEats][2] and gave it a shot.

It's a dish you'll like if you enjoy flan or custards.
A prominent characteristic of this dish is the texture.
The flavours are as-expected, provided primarily by the fruit and flavourings in the batter (vanilla, liquers).
Also a prominent egg flavour.

It's a really easy dish to whip together, as everything comes together quickly and you mix it very smooth.
There's no risk of over-mixing.
