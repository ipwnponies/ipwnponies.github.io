Many medicines have instructions that related to [consumption alongside food or avoiding such][1].
There are 3 periods when medicine can be taken, relative to a meal: before, during, and afterwards.

When eating foods, the body undergoes physiological processes that prepare for meal consumption.
This includes increasing blood flow to the gut and the production of stomach acid.

## Before a Meal

Some medicines are prescribed on an empty stomach.
There can be components of the medicine that might bind or interact with food matter:
taking on a empty stomach ensures the body can directly absorb most of it.

## During a Meal

Some medicines can irritate or inflame the digestion system.
Having a meal will trigger and prepare the body for digestion, which mitigates against this.

Other medicines may require higher blood sugar or incur risk of low blood sugar.
A meal will mitigate against this.

Note that a meal here does not need to be a large meal.
A small snack is enough to induce a digestive response.

## After a Meal

Some medicines are taken after a meal.
This ensures there is food in the digestive system, which slows digestion down.
This can increase the absorption of medicines.
