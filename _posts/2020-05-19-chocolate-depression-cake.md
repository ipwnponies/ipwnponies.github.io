## History

[*Depression cakes*][1] are cakes from the Great Depression.
During this period, cake was a luxury that was attainable with some substitutions:

- water for milk
- shortening for butter
- baking powder for eggs

During World War 1, *war cakes* were popular as a result of rationing.
Ingredients such as milk and eggs were conserved for the war effort, to feed troops.

[*Wacky cake*][2] is specifically a chocolate cake that became popular during World War 2.
It contains no milk, eggs, or butter.
As a result, it's dairy free and vegan.
It can be dusted with powder sugar or a simple glaze, similarly made from limited ration ingredients.

## Recipe

There are many recipes online and they're all roughly the same.
They tend to be oil-based cakes, with emphasis on spices or cocoa.
This masks the lack of flavours.
If you think about it, this is very similar to the instructions for box mix.

The substitutions of milk (with water) and butter (with shortening) are pretty predictable.
Substituting eggs was a new one for me: how do you even do that and why would vinegar be the answer?
Scouring the internet, it seems that low pH will strengthen and tighten gluten.
This strengthening provides the requisite structure to help keep the cake set tall.
