In Spanish, adjectives usually follow the noun.
But there are some adjectives that precede the noun.
In these cases, it changes the meaning of the adjective.

This article from [spanishdict][1] explains it and I've paraphrased it here to assist in my understanding.

## Possessive and Demonstrative Adjective

A possessive adjective are words like _mi_, _tu_, _su_.
In English, these would be _mine_, _yours_, and _theirs_.

Possessive adjectives come before the subject.
Because this is identical to English, students don't usually have trouble with this.

Demonstrative adjectives are words like _this_ and _that_: _eso_ y _esto_.

## Limiting Adjectives

Limiting adjectives are quantifiers.
Counts, uncountable, or qualitative comparators are examples:

- alguno (some)
- demasiado (too much)
- poco (little)
- menos (less)
- unos (some)

All number counts are limiting adjectives.

## Essential Qualities

Descriptive adjectives that emphasize a crucial quality of a noun will have the adjective precede the noun.
_El valiente hombre_ is the _valiant man_.

This is newer to me and I hope to learn this through reading more.

## Meaning-Change Adjective

When an adjective follows the noun, it should be viewed with an objective meaning.
_El carro nuevo_ is a car that is brand-new.
It can also be a new model year car.

When the adjective precedes the noun, one must take a more subjective perspective.
_El nuevo carro_ is a car that is new to you.
That is, you recently bought the car but it could a used car.

This is a tricky concept but I feel you will learn and get the hang of it through exposure.
Here are some examples to reinforce that.

| Precede         | Meaning             | Follow           | Meaning                 |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| alto estudiante | top student         | estudiante alto  | tall student            |
| bajo reloj      | cheap watch         | hombre bajo      | short man               |
| diferente vinos | various wines       | vinos diferentes | different wines         |
| nuevo negocio   | opened a new bakery | negocio nuevo    | new business or startup |
| viejo amigo     | old buddy           | amigo viejo      | elderly friend          |
