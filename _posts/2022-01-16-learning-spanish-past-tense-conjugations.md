There are two past tense verb forms in spanish: _imperfect_ and _preterite_.
English has these concepts but we'll need to dig deeper as it's often tied to other words.
This [article][1] can be used a guide.

## Preterite Form

This is also known as simple past.
In English, it's the basic verb conjugation with an _-ed_ suffix.

> I talked to Joe.

The action is performed and completed.
There is a definitive end and a corresponding specific point in time.

The common trigger words involve specific time-frames:

- _ayer_ (yesterday)
- _hace un año_ (a year ago)
- _esa vez_ (that "one time")

Some verbs exclusively use the preterite form:

- _salir_ (to leave)
- _graduarse_ (to graduate)

It does not make sense for these verbs to ongoing actions.
Nevertheless, you can construct the imperfect form if you wanted, the rules still work.

### Preterite Conjugation of _-ar_ Verbs

- yo hablé
- tú hablaste
- él habló
- nosotros hablamos
- ellos hablaron

### Preterite Conjugation of _-ir_ and _-er_ Verbs

- yo bebí
- tú bebiste
- él bebió
- nosotro bebimos
- ellos bebieron

### _Nosotros_ Form

Note that the _nosotros_ form for _-ar_ and _-ir_ verbs is identical to the present tense (_-er_ verbs change to _imos_).
The tense is determined from context clues from the remainder of the sentence.

I see this and I'm thinking there are two outcomes:

- sentences are always unambiguous, so using preterite form correctly is just verb-tense agreement
- or nosotros form requires disambiguating by explicitly reworking the sentence

## Imperfect Form

Imperfect verbs are actions that are continuous and do not have a definitive end.
In English, these are gerunds.

> I was talking to Joe.

The action is not complete and ongoing (even though it's in the past).

The common trigger words involve general time-frames:

- _a menudo_ (often)
- _a veces_ (sometimes)
- _todo el tiempo_ (all the time)

### Imperfect Conjugation of _-ar_ Verbs

Replace the _-ar_ suffix with _-aba_.

- yo hablaba
- tú hablabas
- él hablaba
- nosotros hablábamos
- ellos hablabaron

### Imperfect Conjugation of _-ir_ and _-er_ Verbs

Replace the _-ar_ suffix with _-ia_.

- yo bebía
- tú bebías
- él bebía
- nosotros bebíamos
- ellos bebían

## Mnemonic Devices For Differentiating

Substitute the verb into a sentence that involves an interruption.

> I was \<imperfect> until \<preterite> happened.

The _imperfect_ verb is the action that was continuous and ongoing.
The _preterite_ verb is the action that interrupted.

> I was talking to Joe when he burst into tears.
