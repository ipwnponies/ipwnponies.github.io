I played [*Thomas Was Alone*][1], an indie platformer from 2012.
It's a beautiful and elegant game.
Somehow they managed to fit in a compelling story about a bunch of different shapes.

## Story

There's actually a story.
It follows the life of a bunch of blocks.

It's hard to explain but the use of narrative drives the story.
In its entirety.
And it does a very good job.

The blocks are AI and they discover and explore more of their world.
Eventually this leads them to escaping to reality.

## Gameplay

There are 11 chapters, with ~10 levels per chapter.
The gameplay is a puzzle platformer, where the goal is to get the blocks to the destination.

The trick is that each block has different abilities and limitations.
They must work together in order to get everyone to the destination.

## Sound

The soundtrack is very beautiful and soothing.
The narration is well-paced and excellent.
It's odd to say that this has better voice acting than some AAA games with voice actors and what not.

## Replayability

I'd say this has a certain amount of replayability.
Its fun comes from the skill and gameplay mechanics and those have stood the test of time.

## Overall

This is a short game that can be completed in 4 hours.
It's 4 well-spent hours.
Go for it.
