After watching the Great American Baking show, I was inspired to make some hand-raised pies.
In the U.K. and Australia, these are very common pastries but they're practically unheard of in North America.
They are meat-filled pies that are wrapped inside a hot water crust, which is sturdy enough to stand on its own without a
pie tin to support it.
They can be eaten warm or cold and function as a portable, on-the-go food.
They're supposedly very popular at soccer games as concession foods, serving the same purpose as a hotdog would for
Americans at a baseball game.

In particular, pork pies are traditional but I decided to go with ground meat.
A [Scotch pie or Scottish pie][1] is a hand-raised pie that is filled with ground beef or lamb.
There's also a dish called [bridies][2] but I think those are more like empanadas or hand pies.

The flavours are very similar to [tourtiere][5], which makes me wonder if they share some ancestry.
The primary flavour components are ground beef, nutmeg, and oregano.

Although things didn't turn out perfect, there's always room to continually improve by doing a retrospective!

## Learnings

### Don't overknead

Not many recipes spoke about the importance of kneading, compared to pie crust recipes.
A hot water crust requires some kneading to develop gluten and structure.
However, I think many recipes are wrong and overwork their pastry dough.

I would recommend kneading it until the dough just comes together and maybe a few more turns.
This will give it strength but still allow it to be tender when cut into.
My crust was chewy and tough, although it looked exactly as many videos online.

The more you knead, the better it will look, aesthetically.
But it's definitely trading off for texture.

### Working with hot water crust

The boiling water [denatures some of the gluten proteins][6].
By denaturing the proteins before kneading, they no longer participate to form long gluten network.
The resulting dough is very soft.
If you're worked with dough, you know that dough needs resting to allow gluten to relax.
Even a short 15-minute rest will make a big difference in making it easier to roll out.

Hot water crust hydrates the flour to a larger extent than shortcrust.
Similar to breads, this [extra hydration will delay dehydration][7] and provide a larger time window for the starches to
gel.
When it's finally evaporated off, the starches contribute to crispiness.

A solid fat is used so that it solidifies once cooled.
This is key to shaping the dough and holding its shape.
You cannot make a hand-raised pie using oil as your fat.
Even all-butter recipes are not recommended as the dough can be too slack in a warm kitchen.
Lard and shortening are the star of the show here.
