Chinese New Year is also a big deal in Vietnamese culture.
It's called Tết and the biggest celebration of the year, akin to Christmas.

The [foods][1] that are associated with Tết include:

- Bánh tét (rice cakes or dumplings, wrapped in banana leaves)
- Thịt kho nước dừa (braised pork, similar to [hong shao rou][2])
- coconut and sesame candies
- mandarins

I was craving some and wanted to get into the spirit, by making some for the first time.
I decided to make banh tet chuoi, the banana filled variant.
The filling and ingredients are a tier easier than the meat-filled ones.

## Banana Leaves

This was the first time I handled banana leaves.
Well, technically this was shortly after I made [tamales][3] so it's my second time.

Banana leaves are unwieldy and there are tips and tricks to wrangle this beast.
Some leaves will be crisp and crunchy, which will readily tear if you tried working with it directly.
They should be parboiled, which will soften the leaves and make them more pliable.

Banana leaves impart a mild flavour onto the dough or sticky rice, which is similar to how vanilla provides mild flavour
backdrop.

## Banh Tet vs. Xoi

After making this, I compared the eating experience to xoi (sweet sticky rice).
Xoi has more texture and brighter flavour contrasts, from not being cooked as long.
Banh tet is comforting as a mass of food.

In a way, it's very much like eating a tamale vs. eating a taco.
Both are dishes made with the same ingredients but applied in different ways to target a different eating experience.
Neither is necessarily better but it's an individual preference.

## Banana Type

My dad said I had to use a [thai banana][4].
I didn't even know where to get one easily, let alone if it was necessary to the dish.
I ended up using a regular ol' cavendish banana to great effect.

Despite my dad's insistence on tradition, it's not practical nor is it pragmatic when it comes to evolution of food.
If the cavendish banana were readily available to the Vietnamese a hundred years ago and were half the price,
do you think they would have still chosen the thai banana?

One of the marks for success is the deep red colour the banana turns after cooking.
Even a cavendish will turn red after cooking.

## Coconut Milk Ratio

My parents insisted on using a ratio of 1 cup of rice (200 g) to 1/3 can of coconut milk (133 ml).
This worked well for me and it was tasty.
But I wonder if I could reduce this ratio to reduce calories.
And I can always serve the coconut milk on the side afterwards.
Does cooking it together result in a sum that is greater than the parts?
Next time, I'm going to see if I can halve it.

## Instant Pot

Typically, cooking banh tet is an ordeal.
My parents talk about spending 8 hours tending to boiling pot.

If you're able to use an Instant Pot, then you're golden.
It'll cook in 1/3 of the time and it's completely hands-free.
You can even skip soaking the glutinous rice and cook it longer.
I ran out of rice and made some more without soaking and you can't tell the difference.
Perhaps the cook time was longer but with pressure cooking, that's like 10 extra minutes to a 40 minute cook time.

## Beans

Beans are added to the rice to give more texture and make it interesting.
I love beans so I've increased the ratio even more.
200g of rice will require 15 g of dry beans or 6 tbsp of canned beans (calculated from a [previous post][5]).
